Create a complete responsive website named **Community Worker** using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is a service-based platform that connects service providers and users. It also has an admin dashboard (for future use) to store service, provider, and user information (only UI now).

Create the following pages:

1. **Home Page**
   - Add a **Hero Section** with a full-width auto-scrolling slider (carousel) using multiple background images.
   - Overlay the project name ‚ÄúCommunity Worker‚Äù and a short tagline like "Connecting Services to Your Doorstep" in bold, centered text.
   - Include a sticky navigation menu with links: Home, Services, About, Contact.

2. **Service Provider Page**
   - Create multiple **responsive cards** like ID cards in a grid layout.
   - Each card must include:
     - Provider image (circular or rounded)
     - Name
     - Service name (e.g., Electrician, Plumber, Mechanic)
     - Address
     - Contact number
   - Use hover effects to make cards interactive and attractive.

3. **About Us Page**
   - Add a well-designed section that explains the **purpose** of the Community Worker platform:
     - Why it was created
     - Who it helps (users and service providers)
     - What problems it solves
     - The goal/mission of the platform
   - Include icons or simple illustrations for better presentation.

4. **Contact Us Page**
   - Create a **feedback form** that includes:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Phone Number
     - Message/Feedback
   - Also, show a list/grid of service provider contact details to help clients connect.
   - Make the form stylish and ensure basic form validation using JavaScript (e.g., check if fields are filled).

üìå Design Instructions:
- Use **clean, modern UI** with soft shadows, rounded corners, and proper spacing.
- Use **Google Fonts** for typography.
- Apply animations (e.g., fade-in, slide) for smooth user experience.
- All pages should be **mobile responsive**.
- Use only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks like Bootstrap).
